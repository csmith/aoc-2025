= Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solution to 2025's https://adventofcode.com/2025[Advent of Code] puzzles in Rust.

Each day is an individual program. Use e.g. `cargo run --bin 01` to run.

Eric has requested that people no longer publish their puzzle inputs so the ones here are encrypted using
https://github.com/elasticdog/transcrypt[Transcrypt]. If you want to test against my input for whatever
reason, get in touch.

I have separate repositories for solutions from previous years:
